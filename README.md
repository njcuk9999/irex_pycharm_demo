# iREx: Pycharm Demonstration

- Most astronomers use at least some python in their research
- many use a LOT of python in their research.

##

- How and where you code is more important than you think!


- Using an IDE (correctly) will 
  - speed up your coding
  - allow you to spend more time on the problem not the coding  
  - reduce the number of bugs you have
  - make you code more readable for others

## IDE: Integrated Development Environment

- Pycharm is an IDE for python

- Others exist (some are better than others)
    - Spyder
    - Sublime Text 3 (with added packages)
    - IDLE
    - Visual Studio Code

## Why Pycharm?

There are many reasons. Here are a few of mine:

- It's **free** (community addition)
   - pro addition - with a university account)
  
- Project management

- **PEP8** (python grammer) suggestions
  
- code completion and suggestions
  
- code syntax highlighting   
  
- code and module indexing
  - Ctrl+Click to nagivate
  - nagivate back and forwards
  
- local version of code history  
  
- git integration is awesome!  
  
- debugging is awesome!
  
- plus much much more!

- It is complicated 
  - there is a lot to it
  - but don't let that put you off!

## Code your projects easily

- Keep the same project in one window
  

- Open a new window with a new project
  

- Remembers which windows are open 
  

- open sub-windows (2x2, 4x4 etc)
  

- **DEMO**: `Split Right` `irex_demo.py`

## Bonus nice features

- jupyter notebook integration (pro only)
- many plugins
   - `example.csv`
  
##
##
##

```

























```

## **DEMO**: `irex_demo.py`

- code completion
- navigation with Ctrl + Click
- local version history

##
##
##

```

























```


## Demo: Debugger

- `idex_demo.py`
- uncomment `neil.study_fish()`
- breakpoint line 166 `irex_functions.py`

##
##
##

```

























```

## Github integration

- new branch: `>> git branch test3`

- make a change and commit it
```
>> git commit origin test3
>> git push origin test3
```

- compare branches 
- merge branches 

```
   >> git checkout test1
   >> git merge test2
```

## Help is always near-by

- Slack
  - we have a `python` channel
  - any problems (with Pycharm or python) ask there
  - most problems someone will have had before!
