- Most astronomers use at least some python in their research
- many use a LOT of python in their research.

## IDE: Integrated Development Environment

- Pycharm is an IDE for python

- Others exist (some are better than others)
    - Spyder
    - Sublime Text 3 (with added packages)
    - IDLE
    - Visual Studio Code
  
```
































```

## Why Pycharm?

There are many reasons. Here are a few of mine:

- It's free (community addition)
- It's free (pro addition - with a university account)
- Project management  
- code completion and suggestions
- code syntax highlighting   
- code and module indexing
  - Ctrl+Click to nagivate
  - nagivate back and forwards
- local version of code history  
- git integration is awesome!  
- debugging is awesome!
- It is complicated 
  - there is a lot to it
  - but don't let that put you off!

```

























```

## Project management

- Keep the same project in one window 
- Open a new window with a new project
- Remembers which windows are open 
- code the same code twice
  - **DEMO**: `Split Right` `irex_demo.py`
